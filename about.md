## 👋 Hello! I'm Jacob (KD9LWR)

I'm a Catholic amateur radio operator, SKYWARN spotter, and ARES Emergency Coordinator for La Porte County, Indiana.

### 📡 Ham Radio

* Callsign: **KD9LWR** (General Class)
* GMRS: **WRQG204**

### 🔧 Background

* 🧠 I enjoy problem-solving, tinkering and DYI'ing.

### 🖥️ Computers

* I run Linux (Kubuntu) for my primary computer,
   but run Win10 for my Ham Shack use.

* I love having multi-displays on my computers.

### 🎧 Audio + Music

* Audiophile with a soft spot for **female-fronted alt rock**—favorites include
   *Tonight Alive*, *YONAKA*, *Edge of Paradise*, and *Poppy*.

* Use a FiiO JM21 loaded with FLAC, with custom EQs and ReplayGain tweaks.

### 🛠 Projects & Hobbies

* Maintain a personal **GitHub Pages blog** for notes, experiments, and food recipes.
* Using a audio mixer so I can listen to all of my ham radio through on pair of headphones.
* Map making with QGIS.
* Recently started exploring **RF filter design**.

## 📫 Contact
* I’m easiest to reach via email. GPG and S/MIME certs available on this site.
