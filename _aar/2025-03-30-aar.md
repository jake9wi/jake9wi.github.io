## Summary:

On 30 March 2025, a severe thunderstorm impacted La Porte
County, Indiana, with wind gusts exceeding 70 miles per hour.
The storm caused substantial disruptions, including widespread
power outages, downed trees, structural damage to buildings,
and blocked roadways throughout unincorporated areas.

## Operational Activities:

- Amateur Radio Operators activated the W9LY VHF repeater for
  the Severe Weather Net, coordinated by Net Control Station
  Rich (KC9DJP), with EMA liaison Dave (W9DLP) actively
  participating.
- The GMRS repeater "Valpo 01" conducted roundtable discussions
  to facilitate reporting and coordinate responses. Reports
  included additional weather information from Lake and
  Porter Counties.
- La Porte County ARES does not currently have a formal SKYWARN
  operations plan and activates based on the discretion and
  perceived necessity of its members.

## Impact:

- Significant power outages affected communities across
  unincorporated La Porte County.
- Whole neighborhoods in Michigan City experienced power
  outages lasting up to three or four days.
- Numerous trees were downed, and structural damage was
  reported to multiple buildings.
- Debris on roadways required significant clean-up efforts.
- Minimal damage was reported within the City of La Porte itself.

## Recommendations:

- Develop a formalized SKYWARN operational plan for La Porte
  County ARES to standardize and streamline activation procedures.
- Continue routine training for severe weather communication
  protocols and net operations.
- Enhance communication and cooperation between Amateur Radio
  and GMRS operators for efficient information sharing during
  emergencies.
