When we speak, it is common to say things like *“that thing”*
or use vague slang. But this is a poor habit. Why? Because
the person we are communicating with may have no idea what
*“that thing”* refers to — or they may think you mean an
entirely different *“that thing.”*

This is where precision becomes essential. Language is the
product of generations of refinement. We have countless words
that help us express ourselves clearly and accurately. If
we ignore this, we risk confusion, inefficiency, or
even disaster.

## Example: Tenerife Airport Disaster (1977)

One of the deadliest aviation disasters in history — the
*Tenerife Airport Disaster* — shows how a lack of verbal
precision can have catastrophic consequences.

On 27 March 1977, two Boeing 747 jumbo jets — a KLM flight
and a Pan Am flight — collided on a fog-shrouded runway in
the Canary Islands, killing 583 people. The disaster occurred
because of ambiguous and imprecise communication between the
flight crews and air traffic control.

Crucially, the KLM captain, eager to depart, radioed
*“We are now at takeoff”* — a non-standard phrase. The
air traffic controller responded with a simple *“OK,”* which
the KLM crew interpreted as clearance to proceed. Meanwhile,
the Pan Am aircraft was still taxiing on the same runway,
obscured by thick fog.

Neither the KLM crew nor the controller used standard
phraseology, and the position of the Pan Am jet was never
clearly confirmed. This lack of verbal precision led the
KLM aircraft to begin its takeoff prematurely — directly
into the path of the other plane.

## Conclusion

This tragedy shows what can happen when we are not careful
with our words. While most of us will never face such
high-stakes situations, that does not mean we should be lax
about clarity. Even a small slip — like saying *“bring me
that thing”* — can waste time, cause frustration, or create
unnecessary problems.

Words are tools. Use them with care.
