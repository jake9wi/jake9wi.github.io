When we speak it is common to say "that thing" or use some
slang word. But this is a bad practice. Why? Because the person
we are communicating with very likely do not know what "that thing"
means or they think you mean some other "that thing".

This is where precision comes to our aid. Language has generations
upon generations of defining the correct word to help get our point across
and if we fail to use this to our aid we will feel the consequences.

## Example: Tenerife Airport Disaster (1977)

One of the deadliest aviation disasters in history — the
*Tenerife Airport Disaster* — illustrates the life-and-death
stakes of precision in spoken language.

On 27 March 1977, two Boeing 747 jumbo jets — a KLM flight
and a Pan Am flight — collided on a foggy runway in the
Canary Islands, killing 583 people. The disaster unfolded
because of ambiguous and imprecise communication between the
pilots and air traffic control.

Crucially, the KLM captain, eager to depart, radioed
*"We are now at takeoff"*. The air traffic controller
responded simply with "OK" leading the KLM captain to
believe he was cleared for takeoff. Meanwhile, the
Pan Am plane was still taxiing on the same runway,
unseen in the thick fog.

Neither the KLM captain or the air traffic controller
used standard phraseology nor was KLM's position confirmed.
This lack of verbal precision led the KLM aircraft beginning
its takeoff prematurely — directly into the path of the
other plane.

## Conclusion

This example shows what can result when we are not careful
with our words. While our words rarely have such consequences
this does not mean we can be lax with ourselves and others.

Even just something small like "bring me that thing" can
waste ours and other's time when they bring the wrong thing.
